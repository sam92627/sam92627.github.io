            <h2>Hi, Stranger!</h2>
                </header>
                <p>A person is happy when he achieves a harmony between a family, work and friends. I would add trips to this list. The idea of starting my blog hit me long time ago, but just now I have finally made myself sum up the most memorable trips of my life.
                    The places I love, stayed not as a tourist, the places that I strongly believe influenced my personality.</p>
                <h3>A couple of facts about me</h3>
                    <blockquote>
                     <ul>
                         <li>I <strong>LOVE</strong> travelling and everyhing that foreruns it, planning the trips, capturing the photo moments, trying exotic food, and having a pleasant feeling of tired legs at the end of exploring a new place.</li>
                        <li>Since childhood I have dreamt of a dog and a bicycle. Though I got my two-wheel friend recenty, a little has left to be done.</li>                        
                        <li>I constantly get inspired with the nature. No less I value the ability of a person to create and change the world. These are two sides of the same coin that can only exist in synergy.</li>
                        <li>The most important for a person is the desire for consciousness: the comprehension of the world and yourself. Once we learn how to hear ourselves and each other, differentite reality from illusions, accept the responsibility for everything that is happening to us and not be scared of it, then we have no other choice but fell in love with this magnificant world.</li>
                        <li>My to-do &amp; to-try list is always growing. Though I don`t have enough courage to try a quater of the things, I`m enormously happy to have likeminded friends. Doing adventirous stuff together is easier.</li>
                    </ul>
                    </blockquote>
