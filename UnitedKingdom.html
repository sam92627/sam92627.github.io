                      <p>3 years is a very short time to explore the whole country (yes, you can see the best of it though). 3 years in UK is almost ridiculously little. 
                     Still, I accepted the challenge, and present to you is my "London: to-do and to-see list", a summary of 3 years in UK guide.
                     So here you are in London.Probably, like always, you have to leave a lot of things out. Won’t visit the Royal Palaces,
                     will skip over Big Ben and won’t stand in line with the other tourists at the Tower of London. Still, you will manage to see a whole lot of the British capital.
                     You will see great art in some of the world’s best galleries. Visit Hyde Park. There’s a stroll through Notting Hill, and a peek at the Tower Bridge, albeit, from afar.
                     Some beloved places didn’t make it into the schedule (because, really, how much famous pubs can you visit in a day?).
                     But now, without further ado, let me show you London in 12hrs!</p>
                <h3>9 am//Tate Modern</h3>
                <div class="photobanner">
                    <img class="first" src="tate.jpg" alt="tate" />
                    <img src="tate1.jpg" alt="tate1" />
                    <img src="tate2.jpg" alt="tate" />
                </div>
                 <p>
                    Grab a snack and an English breakfast tea, we have a long day ahead of us. Our first stop is Tate Modern. Lets kick off our day with some modern art.
                    Tate Modern functions as Britain’s national gallery of international modern art, and is the world’s most visited modern art gallery.
                    Housed in an old power station right at the river, it draws crowds of art lovers, tourists, and school children alike.                    
                    You could easily spend a whole day here, and if you have more time in London, you definitely should spend some more hours here than we do today.
                    The exhibitions are amazing, and admission is free! Two big attractions of Tate Modern are the Turbine Hall and The Tanks.</p>
               <h3>11 am//Borough Market</h3>
                <div class="photobanner">
                    <img class="first" src="market.jpg" alt="market" />
                    <img src="market1.jpg" alt="market" />
                    <img src="market2.jpg" alt="market" />
                </div>
                <p> London is all about that fantastic mix of the new and the old, something you’ll experience several times during our 12hrs.
                    From the new world of modern art, let’s move on to something traditionally British, the markets.                    
                    Borough Market is one of London’s oldest and biggest food markets, and to me, it’s also one of the prettiest.
                    Local vendors are selling fresh produce, and there are stalls that serve all kinds of tasty things. Walk around, wet your appetite, you can have your lunch there!</p>
           <h3>1 pm//London Bridge</h3>
                <div class="photobanner">
                <img class="first" src="bridge.jpg" alt="bridge" />
                <img src="bridge1.jpg" alt="bridge" />
                <img src="bridge3.jpg" alt="bridge" />
            </div>
                <p>There’s no better time for a walk than after lunch (since laying down is not an option on this busy day).
                    So let’s continue our tour of London, lose some calories, and get a bit of sightseeing done in the process.
                    Walk up to London Bridge, it’s just a stone-throw away from the market.Elliot’s, and head over to the other side of the Thames.
                    To your right, you’ll get a great view of the iconic Tower Bridge. There’s also a mean looking World War II war ship moored in the river, the HMS Belfast.
                    Snap some pictures for you loved ones at home – Tower Bridge, River Thames or war ship, whatever will be most popular with your folks – and make your way
                    to the other side.</p>
                <h3>2pm//Hyde Park</h3>
                <div class="photobanner">
                    <img class="first" src="park.jpg" alt="park" />
                    <img src="park1.jpg" alt="park" />
                    <img src="park3.jpg" alt="park" />
                </div>
                <p>Back to one of those iconic London places. The Royal Hyde Park lays in the middle of the city and is one of London’s biggest parks.
                    Famous for its Speakers’ Corner, it attracts a pleasant mix of visitors. Families, tourists, and commuters on their jog to work carrying
                    their office attire in tiny backpacks while running. Soak in the scene and maybe even some sun as you walk through the park.
                    Just follow the paths along the The Serpentine, a lake in the middle of the park. It leads you to our next destination.If you’re lucky, you’ll
                    still be able to spot a big, fiberglass statue in the middle of the water. That’s actor Colin Firth as Mr. Darcy, in that famous ‘wet shirt scene’ from
                    the BBC adaptation of Jane Austen’s Pride and Prejudice.</p>
                <h3>4pm//Serpentine Gallery</h3>
                <div class="photobanner">
                    <img class="first" src="gallery.jpg" alt="gallery" />
                    <img src="gallery1.jpg" alt="gallery" />
                    <img src="gallery2.jpg" alt="gallery" />
                </div>
               <p> In Kensington Gardens, right in the middle of Hyde Park, lies Serpentine Gallery. One of London’s most loved galleries, it attracts up to 800 000 visitors
                each year. On display are works by different contemporary artists, and conveniently, admission is free (although they suggest that you donate 1 Pound to them).                
                While the exhibition inside is well worth a visit, we are really here for the pavilion. Each year, the gallery commissions a different architect or artist
                to build a temporary structure in front of the gallery. In past years, these pavilions have been designed by icons of the design world like Ai Wei Wei, 
                Frank Gehry, Oscar Niemeyer, Daniel Libeskind or Rem Koolhaas.                
                In 2013, Japanese master architect Sou Fujimoto was responsible for the pavilion. His airy structure is beautiful and fascinating, and invites visitors
                to climb around on it. Go ahead, climb a bit!</p>
                <h3>5 pm//What else</h3>
                <div class="photobanner">
                    <img class="first" src="another.jpg" alt="another" />
                    <img src="another1.jpg" alt="another" />
                    <img src="another2.jpg" alt="another" />
                </div> 
                We’ve crossed London from the South bank of the Thames to Notting Hill. Drop by a some old pub, lean back in the cozy seats, enjoy your pine, and rewind.
                You’ve just spent 8hrs in London! And if you are still alive, here is a list of places you might be interested to visit to complere your 12hrs day in London.
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Dover Street Market</strong> – The window displays are cooperations with well-known artists, and the shop itself and its interior almost passes as pieces of artwork itself.</li>
                    <li><strong>Liberty London/Oxford Circus</strong> – You can easily drown in a never ending stream of shoppers and tourists here. If you have only time to visit one 
                        of the famous department stores London has to offer, definitely make it Liberty!</li>
                    <li><strong>Notting Hill</strong> – Take a stroll down Portobello Road, and you can see the markings of the stalls of the famous street market on the pavement.
                      No worries, you didn’t miss out by skipping this market, it’s overrun by tourists and some people claim it has lost a bit of its charm lately.
                       But Notting Hill still is super charming and lovely. Walk down some side streets, and you’ll see pastel colored houses and perfectly groomed gardens.</li>
                </ul>
